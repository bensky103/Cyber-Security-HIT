# Logging Requirements for Communication_LTD Ticket System

## Overview

This document outlines the logging requirements for the Communication_LTD Ticket System API, focusing specifically on security-related logging such as CSRF validation and rate limiting.

## Logging Levels

The system uses the following logging levels:

- **INFO**: Standard operational logs including successful operations
- **WARNING**: Potential security issues that require attention but are not immediate threats
- **ERROR**: Failed operations and security violations that require immediate attention
- **DEBUG**: Detailed diagnostic information (only in development environment)

## CSRF Token Validation Logging

### INFO Level
- All successful mutating operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) with valid CSRF tokens
- Log entries should include:
  - Timestamp
  - Operation type and endpoint
  - User ID (if authenticated)
  - Client IP address
  - Request ID

Example log entry:
```
[INFO] 2025-08-11T09:15:23Z - POST /api/v1/tickets - User ID: 123 - IP: 192.168.1.1 - Valid CSRF token - Request ID: req-abcd1234
```

### WARNING Level
- Missing CSRF token in mutating requests
- Invalid CSRF token in mutating requests
- Expired CSRF token in mutating requests
- Log entries should include:
  - Timestamp
  - Operation type and endpoint
  - User ID (if authenticated)
  - Client IP address
  - Reason for failure
  - Request ID

Example log entry:
```
[WARNING] 2025-08-11T09:16:45Z - POST /api/v1/tickets - IP: 192.168.1.1 - Missing CSRF token - Request ID: req-efgh5678
```

## Rate Limiting Logging

### WARNING Level
- When a client's request rate approaches the configured threshold (typically 80%)
- When rate limiting is applied to a client
- Log entries should include:
  - Timestamp
  - Client identifier (IP address, user ID, API key)
  - Current request count
  - Limit threshold
  - Time window
  - Request ID

Example log entries:
```
[WARNING] 2025-08-11T09:20:12Z - IP: 192.168.1.1 - Rate limit threshold approaching - 48/60 requests in 60s - Request ID: req-ijkl9012
[WARNING] 2025-08-11T09:21:05Z - User ID: 123 - Rate limit exceeded - 61/60 requests in 60s - Request ID: req-mnop3456
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Use a structured logging format that's machine-parsable (e.g., JSON)
2. Include sufficient context in each log entry for troubleshooting
3. Ensure sensitive data is not logged (e.g., tokens, passwords)
4. Implement log rotation to manage log file sizes
5. Consider centralized log collection for production environments

## Log Storage and Retention

- Security-related logs should be retained for a minimum of 90 days
- All logs should be stored in a secure location with appropriate access controls
- Consider regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) when implementing log retention policies

## Monitoring and Alerts

- Configure alerts for consecutive failed CSRF validations from the same IP
- Set up monitoring for unusual patterns in rate limit warnings
- Implement a dashboard for visualizing security log metrics
